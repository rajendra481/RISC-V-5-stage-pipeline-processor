# RISC-V-5-stage-pipeline-processor
“Designed a 5-stage RISC-V pipelined CPU in SystemVerilog with forwarding, stall logic, branch handling, and load/store memory. Built a self-checking testbench in Synopsys VCS and debugged pipeline execution using Verdi, validating correct register updates, memory access, and instruction flow.”
